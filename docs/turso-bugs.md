# turso bugs found with SQLRight

Findings from running the SQLRight rewrite against tursopg (the PostgreSQL
frontend of turso). The turso version is the submodule commit in this
repository. Each entry has a minimal SQL reproducer. Run a reproducer with:

```bash
printf '<sql>' > repro.sql
crates/sqlright-harness-tursopg/target/release/sqlright-harness-tursopg --replay repro.sql
```

The list is for the turso team to turn into issues. SQLRight does not fix
turso bugs.

## 1. Crash: two-argument extension aggregate in a GROUP BY query

`percentile_cont` with two column arguments inside a `GROUP BY` query
panics with a slice index error in `core/ext/function.rs`
(`ExtFunc::step_aggregate`, `NativeAggregate`):

```sql
CREATE TABLE t(a float8);
INSERT INTO t VALUES (0.5);
SELECT percentile_cont(a, a) FROM t GROUP BY a;
```

```text
thread 'main' panicked at core/ext/function.rs:111:45:
range end index 28 out of range for slice of length 27
```

The same query without `GROUP BY` returns `0.5`, and
`SELECT percentile_cont(0.5, a) FROM t GROUP BY a` works too. The crash
needs two column arguments and a `GROUP BY`. The register range of the
aggregate arguments (`registers[start_reg..start_reg + argc]`) goes past
the end of the register file, so the planner gives the aggregate fewer
argument registers than `argc` in the grouped path.

Found by: the AFL++ dry run on a seed from the PostgreSQL regression test
`aggregates.sql` (the original statement is
`select p, percentile_cont(p,p) from generate_series(1,5) x, (values (0::float8),(0.1),...) v(p) group by p order by p;`).

## 2. WHERE accepts a non-boolean expression

PostgreSQL rejects a WHERE expression that is not boolean
(`argument of WHERE must be type boolean, not type integer`). tursopg
accepts it and treats the value like SQLite does: zero and NULL are false,
everything else is true.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (c1 INT);
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1), (2), (3), (0), (NULL);
SELECT count(*) FROM t WHERE c1;      -- tursopg: 3      PostgreSQL: error
SELECT count(*) FROM t WHERE 2.5;     -- tursopg: 5      PostgreSQL: error
SELECT count(*) FROM t WHERE 'abc';   -- tursopg: 0      PostgreSQL: error
SELECT NOT 5, CASE WHEN 5 THEN 'yes' ELSE 'no' END;   -- tursopg: 0 yes   PostgreSQL: error
```

Found by: the NoREC oracle. The first campaign reported this more than 800
times because one library statement had the predicate below (bug 3), and
`SUM((pred)::INT)` summed the integer values while `WHERE pred` counted
the rows. The NoREC rewrite now uses `CASE WHEN`, so the oracle no longer
depends on strict boolean typing.

## 3. Bit shift with an array operand is accepted

PostgreSQL has no `integer << integer[]` operator. tursopg evaluates it
and returns the left operand, as if the array were 0.

```sql
SELECT 5 << ARRAY[1, 2];                                        -- tursopg: 5   PostgreSQL: error
SELECT 5 << array_cat(ARRAY[[2, 4], [4, 10]], ARRAY[1, 2]);     -- tursopg: 5   PostgreSQL: error
```

Found by: the NoREC oracle (see bug 2).

## 4. Index lookup and expression disagree on a `date` primary key

An integer inserted into a `date` column is stored as the date of that
Julian day. After that, `WHERE c1 = 0` finds the row through the primary
key index, but the same comparison is false when it is evaluated as an
expression. Without the index the count is 0.

```sql
CREATE TABLE v0 (c1 date PRIMARY KEY);
INSERT INTO v0 VALUES (0);
SELECT c1, c1 = 0 FROM v0;             -- -4713-11-24 0      (the comparison is false)
SELECT count(*) FROM v0 WHERE c1 = 0;  -- 1                  (the index finds the row)
CREATE TABLE v1 (c1 date);
INSERT INTO v1 VALUES (0);
SELECT count(*) FROM v1 WHERE c1 = 0;  -- 0                  (no index: consistent with the expression)
```

The same happens with a `UNIQUE` index instead of the primary key. With a
valid date (`INSERT INTO v0 VALUES ('2024-01-02')`) both forms agree.
PostgreSQL rejects the insert (`column "c1" is of type date but expression
is of type integer`), so the first problem is the accepted insert; given
the accepted row, the index and the expression must still agree.

Related: with the index, `WHERE c1 = 'abc'` fails with `invalid date
value`; without the index the same query returns 0 rows.

Found by: the NoREC oracle, round 3 (the only report of that round that
was not a transaction-marker false positive).

## 5. A column that is neither grouped nor aggregated is accepted with GROUP BY

PostgreSQL rejects a select target that is not in the GROUP BY clause and
not inside an aggregate (`column "v4.c6" must appear in the GROUP BY
clause or be used in an aggregate function`). tursopg accepts it and
returns the value of one row of the group, like SQLite does. Which row
depends on the plan: the same query with a different WHERE clause gives
another value for the same group.

```sql
CREATE TABLE v4 (c5 INT, c6 INT);
INSERT INTO v4 VALUES (1, 10), (2, 20), (2, 30), (2, 40), (5, 50);
SELECT c6 FROM v4 GROUP BY c5;                        -- tursopg: 10 20 50        PostgreSQL: error
SELECT c6 FROM v4 WHERE NOT (c6 = 30) GROUP BY c5;    -- tursopg: 10 20 50
SELECT c6 FROM v4 WHERE c6 = 30 GROUP BY c5;          -- tursopg: 30
```

Found by: the TLP oracle, round 4 (two reports). The TLP oracle now takes
a grouped SELECT only when its target is one of the GROUP BY expressions.
